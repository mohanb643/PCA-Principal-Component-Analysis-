# PCA-Principal-Component-Analysis-
This repository contains explanations, examples, and Python implementations of **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**.   PCA is a **dimensionality reduction technique** used in machine learning and statistics to simplify datasets by reducing the number of features while preserving most of the important information (variance).
